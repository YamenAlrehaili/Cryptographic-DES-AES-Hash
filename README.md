# Cryptographic-DES-AES-Hash Using CLI
**This is a cryptographic project developed as part of CS 433 Computer Security course. The project implements encryption and decryption using DES and AES, as well as a one-way hash function using SHA256 and SHA512 in Java.**
The project was developed to demonstrate the practical application of cryptographic techniques and to enhance our understanding of computer security.
## Features
* Encryption and decryption using DES and AES
* One-way hash function using SHA256 and SHA512
* ## This text file will be used next
